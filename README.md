# Nusic

An android app called Nusic which combines music recommendation algorithms similar to those of Spotify and Apple music with the UI for 
giving feedback on those songs similar to that of Tinder. For each music recommendation a card would display which plays the “best part”
of the song, the user would then be able to swipe left or right to like or dislike the song. This feedback would then be used in a cosine 
distance algorithm to find more recommendations. The app would also contain chat functionality for sharing certain music.
